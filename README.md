## 📌 About This Project
This is the first project I ever created while learning web development.  
I built this calculator to practice:

- Basic HTML structure  
- CSS styling  
- JavaScript interactivity  

It helped me understand how web pages work, how buttons can trigger logic, and how user input can be handled in real-time.  
Although it’s simple, this project is very close to my heart — it was my first step into the world of web development. 🌱

This project was originally created around 2022 during my early learning phase and uploaded to GitHub on May 31, 2025.
