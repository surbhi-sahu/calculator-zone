## 📌 About This Project

This is the **first project** I ever created while learning web development.  
I built this calculator to practice:

- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling
- JavaScript interactivity

It helped me understand how web pages work, how buttons can trigger logic, and how user input can be handled in real-time.  
Although it’s simple, this project is **very close to my heart** — it was my first step into the world of web development. 🌱
